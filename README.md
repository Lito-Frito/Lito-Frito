### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Summary
I'm a lifelong learner who's always interested in picking up a new skill to incorporate it into what I do. I'm also a self-taught programmer who loves Python! :snake: sss gang. Here's a [Github resume](https://resume.github.io/?Lito-Frito) to give you an overview of some of my projects. I've also a [blog](https://www.lito-frito.com/) that explains in lighter detail the purpose and value of the projects I've made.

I have a degree in accounting and I've worked in finance for a few years. I've also a Master's in IT from [UMass Lowell](https://gps.uml.edu/degrees/grad/online-master-information-technology-degree.cfm). 

Leveraging my teaching experience, I want to make technology more approachable and understandable by anyone. My exposure and studies around GAAP and Sarbanes Oxley has led me to want to create a framework to audit tech companies on the code they create and their collection, usage, and storage of data in order to benefit both users and companies. My life-long goal is to prevent future incidents like the [Equifax hack](https://www.cnet.com/news/equifaxs-hack-one-year-later-a-look-back-at-how-it-happened-and-whats-changed/) from happening again and ensuring users and companies are on the same page about [what's being asked from them](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/04/19/bose-headphones-have-been-spying-on-their-customers-lawsuit-claims/) when they use tech.
